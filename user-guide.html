📊 INTERPRETING RESULTS

Below is what each metric means.

⭐ Annual Return

How much the fund gained per year on average.

⭐ Volatility / SD

Measures how much the NAV fluctuates.

Higher = more risk.

⭐ Sharpe Ratio

Risk-adjusted return per unit of total risk

Higher = better

⭐ Treynor Ratio

Return per unit of systematic risk (beta)

Useful if fund is well diversified

⭐ Beta

How sensitive the fund is to market (Nifty50)

>1 → more volatile than market

<1 → less volatile

⭐ Alpha

Extra return that fund generated OVER what its beta explains

Positive = outperformer
Negative = underperformer

⭐ Correlation

Strength of movement with Nifty50.

⭐ R-Squared

How “index-like” the fund is.

⭐ Systematic Risk

Market-related risk.

⭐ Unsystematic Risk

Fund-specific risk (diversifiable).

⭐ Tracking Error

Deviation vs benchmark—lower is better for index funds.

⭐ CAPM Expected Return

Theoretically expected return given market conditions.
